# Requirements and Why We Included Them

### User Interactions
- We used the JOptionPane function so that a user can create their own restaurant object and instantiate the variables of that object with their own values.

### Getters and Setters
- We set the variables of the properties in the restaurant class to private so that the they can only be accessed from within that class. This is a part of the encapsulation principle and helps control access to the variables of each restaurant object.

### Array List
- We created the array list to act as a way to store the data for each restaurant object that is created by the user.

### toString()
- We used the toString() method to format the data input by the user and display it on the console in an orderly way that is easy to understand.
